  utter_overview:
  - text: "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  
In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging 
from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 
The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
  
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment.  People who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.

  Common symptoms include:

  fever
  tiredness
  dry cough.
  Other symptoms include:

  shortness of breath
  aches and pains
  sore throat
  and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.
  People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.

People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention."

  utter_prevention:
  - text: "To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:

Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.
Avoid touching your face.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Stay home if you feel unwell.
Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.
Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.
