  utter_covid-19:
  - text: COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered
      coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began
      in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
  utter_covid-19_vs_sars:
  - text: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak
      of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other
      genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more
      deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks
      of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
  utter_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. WHO is assessing
      ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
      findings.
  utter_incubation_period:
  - text: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning
      to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for
      COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates
      will be updated as more data become available.
  utter_emergency_number:
  - text: the emercency number for {country} is {number}
  utter_coronavirus:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals
      or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections
      ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
      discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways. COVID-19\
      \ is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate\
      \ symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment.  People who have\
      \ underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk\
      \ of developing severe disease and death.\nCommon symptoms include:\nfever tiredness\
      \ dry cough. Other symptoms include:\nshortness of breath aches and pains sore\
      \ throat and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.\
      \ People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and\
      \ contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on\
      \ testing and referral.\nPeople with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should\
      \ call their doctor and seek medical attention."
  utter_prevention:
  - text: "To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:\n\
      Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based\
      \ hand rub. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing\
      \ or sneezing. Avoid touching your face. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing\
      \ or sneezing. Stay home if you feel unwell. Refrain from smoking and other\
      \ activities that weaken the lungs. Practice physical distancing by avoiding\
      \ unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people."
